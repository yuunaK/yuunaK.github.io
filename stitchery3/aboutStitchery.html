			<h2>The Stitchery Way</h2>
			<p>All Stitchery dresses are hand stitched one at a time.
			Each dress is a hand produced item. Each dress is unique. 
			Each dress is as special as the hand stitched heirloom 
			garments grandmothers and mothers make for their children.</p>
			<p>Dresses are made using innovative construction techniques.
			The design and pattern cutting of our dresses varies with 
			the fabric. I call this approach “found” method since we 
			find our method in each fabric we take up. Found method 
			does not have the cutting and pinning associated with 
			draping.Found method is not about exclusively cutting on the
			bias, cutting on the grain or against the grain. In our 
			method, the fabric takes center stage in every aspect of 
			garment production: from design to construction. Different 
			types of fabric dictate different methods of fabric processing, 
			garment design, and garment construction.</p>
			<p>Fabric cutting and fabric wastage are kept to a minimum.
			Typical pattern cutting creates waste. With found pattern cutting 
			techniques, this reduces how much fabric is lost in the process of
			cutting garment patterns. When you pay for a dress, you will be 
			receiving most of the fabric required to make the dress. This is 
			good for you and for the environment.</p>
			<p>Dresses are made out of natural fabrics that launder 
			and wear well. We only select natural fabrics that 
			launder well and wear well.  This means no visits to dry cleaners
			or hunting around for specialist cleaners to maintain your garments.  
			Stitchery dresses are made to be worn and laundered and worn again
			as many times as you wish without having to worry about special 
			maintenance requirements.</p>
			<p>All dresses are made with great attention to detail.
			We carefully select fabrics that are environmentally friendly, 
			sustainable, whenever possible dyed and processed using non-toxic
			methods.  We try to use peace ( ahimsa ) silks - silks produced 
			without killing the silkworm that produces the cocoon from which
			the silk fiber is reeled.  We try to be mindful of the lifecycle
			from conception to wasteheap.  In addition, in the producing the 
			garments, necklines, armlines, waistlines, pleats - all aspects 
			of each dress are designed and constructed so they are comfortable 
			to wear and look attractive.</p>
			<p>Hems in our dresses are generous and all our dresses are either
			constructed of double-layered fabric or fully lined.</p>
